Selected Features for AF Detection
=================================

Features in order of selection (most important first):

1. SpEn
2. LF_Power
3. HF_Power
4. LF_HF_Ratio
5. MAVcA
6. AEcA
7. STDcA
8. Detail1_Energy
9. Detail2_Energy
10. Detail3_Energy
11. VFCDM_Centroid
12. VFCDM_Flatness

Feature selection helps reduce overfitting and improves model generalization.
The order of selection indicates the relative importance of each feature for AF detection.
